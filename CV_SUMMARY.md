## üé§ 30-Second Pitch Script

*"For my bootcamp final project, I built a production website for a cleaning company using microservices architecture. I deployed three containerized services on Kubernetes - a frontend built with Astro, and two backend services for email and AI chat. Everything runs on a single Azure VM using K3s for orchestration and Nginx as a reverse proxy. I implemented enterprise-grade infrastructure including TrueNAS Scale for automated backups with RAID mirroring, Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring, and Let's Encrypt for SSL encryption. The system is GDPR-compliant, multilingual, and includes disaster recovery capabilities with daily automated snapshots. It's currently serving real customers at zoman.switzerlandnorth.cloudapp.azure.com."*
