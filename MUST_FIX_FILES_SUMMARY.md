## ✅ What This Fixes

### High Priority Issues (MUST FIX)
1. ✅ **Exposed Monitoring Ports**
   - Before: Public HTTP on ports 30030/30090
   - After: HTTPS via subdomains only

2. ✅ **Weak Grafana Password**
   - Before: `admin123`
   - After: `Zoman2024!SecureGrafana#`

3. ✅ **No Prometheus Authentication**
   - Before: Open to anyone
   - After: Basic auth required

### Additional Improvements (BONUS)
4. ✅ **Security Headers** (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
5. ✅ **Pinned Docker Versions** (reproducible deployments)
6. ✅ **Network Isolation** (ClusterIP instead of NodePort)

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

After implementing this, you can say you have experience with:

**Security:**
- SSL/TLS certificate management
- HTTP authentication mechanisms
- Security headers (OWASP best practices)
- Network segmentation

## 🏆 Success Looks Like

When everything is working:

- ✅ https://grafana.zoman.switzerlandnorth.cloudapp.azure.com (HTTPS, green padlock)
- ✅ https://prometheus.zoman.switzerlandnorth.cloudapp.azure.com (HTTPS, requires auth)
- ❌ http://20.250.146.204:30030 (timeout/fail)
- ❌ http://20.250.146.204:30090 (timeout/fail)
- ✅ All security headers present
- ✅ Strong passwords required
- ✅ Services survive reboot

**Then you can confidently say:**

"I deployed a production-grade monitoring stack with enterprise security: HTTPS encryption, authentication, security headers, and network isolation following OWASP and Zero Trust principles."
